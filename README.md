Allows the player to take captured prisoners as slaves.

Mostly untested version of [Ziehn's 1.0 update](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1635565299).

Original mod by Thirite, updated to 1.0 by Ziehn, updated to 1.1 by me.

## May contain breaking bugs. Let me know if you find any.

The description is mostly copied over from the 1.0 version. It might not be fully up to date.

## How to Capture a Slave
You'll first need to make a Slave Collar at either the Smithy, Crafting Spot, Tailor Benches or Machining Table then in the Prisoner Tab, select the new option, "Enslave". After that your warden will fasten it to their neck, and presto! They're now a useful member of your slave-driving colony. Slaves typically won't be happy about their situation and will make repeated escape attempts until their willpower has been broken. You can get a general idea of how low their willpower is from checking the negative mood effect of their "Enslaved" thought: it starts at a -15 mood penalty and rises from there. When a slave attempts to escape, you'll have to send out a pawn to catch them; assuming you're successful, they'll be carried to a prison cell where they will be interned for a few hours. After that they will resume their duties as a slave.

## What Can Slaves Do?
Currently they function very similarly to a normal colonist-- able to perform typical jobs, be designated colonist beds, may be drafted, etc. Of course they will probably still try to escape.

## Emancipating Slaves
Toggle on the "Emancipate" gizmo after selecting a slave. A warden will then autonomously set them free, or you may prioritize it like most other orders. Once this is done, they will be considered a released prisoner and leave for home. However, if you emancipate a slave while they are in a prison cell, they will stay as your prisoner- though freed of slavery.

## Buying and Selling Slaves
Slaves can be purchased from the same traders as in vanilla- but will now maintain status as a slave when they join your colony. You may also sell any slave in your colony in the same way you would sell a prisoner. Slaves purchased from a trader will already have their willpower broken, and will typically not attempt to escape (with the exclusion of Iron willed pawns).

## F.A.Q.
### Q. Is this compatible with Prison Labor?
A. Yes, I haven't used Prison Labor much myself but this takes a different approach. It pretty much comes down to which roleplaying flavor you prefer, Prison Labor makes it feel like your running a prison camp while Simple Slavery does better at playing being a slaver. They can be used at the same time. See Compatibility for more details.

### Q. I can't unequip collars, help!
A. If you are using the Rpg Inventory mod click the "Show List" button to view and unequip collars.

### Q. My slaves are bald with collars equiped.
A. [Show Hair With Hats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180826364)

### Q. My Slave escaped and is no longer on my colonist bar, what do?
A. Wait. No really just wait, after a half day or so they will rejoin your colony after their time out in prison.

## Compatibility
Prison Labor mod's "Motivation Mechanic" seems to interrupt escaping slaves causing them to wander aimlessly, you can turn it off in Prison Labor's mod options.

Multiplayer "works" but any of the UI mechanics will desync. Emancipate, Shackle, Special Collar functions ect...

## Note
This is still a work in progress, but it seems pretty stable from my quick tests. It should be suitable for normal (non-debugging) gameplay but I'm sure the balance is likely in need of refining.

## Disclaimer
This mod is not meant to condone real world slavery, whether past or present. If you can't differentiate between a videogame and real life then you shouldn't be playing RimWorld to begin with.
