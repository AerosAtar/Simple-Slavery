			There is now an alert for when slaves are in timeout. Hopefully this will make it more clear that they're supposed to be in prison.

			Simple Slavery now has new features!|
			Saves should be compatible. Ideally, saves shouldn't get broken going forward with any update (but going back might break them, as is the case with this update).|
			There's a new "Slaves" button at the bottom with all the other buttons.|
			From there, you can see all each slave's willpower, adjust a slave's shackles, or emancipate them.|
			There are now mod settings! You can adjust the rate at which willpower decreases, change how much a slave is valued to the storyteller, disable escapes, and show slaves in the colonist bar!|
			The "miserable slaves" alert will now list which slaves are miserable.
			If you have a mod that integrates with Simple Slavery and makes use of a slave's willpower, it will need to be updated since willpower is now a float between 0f and 1f (as opposed to 0f and 100f). I don't know of any mods this would affect, but there might be some out there.
